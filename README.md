## Overview
### Description
A productivity app that is designed to keep any individual on track of work during quarantine.
Users will be able to join study/work rooms with specific tags with a global productivity timer (Pomodoro method) or rooms with a silent video calling feature. The rooms are designed to create a sense time and community that might be lacking in this time of quarantine.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer as a website. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices as long as the device contains a built in camera/microphone. However mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Connects users who work on similar tasks in break-out rooms.
- **Market:** Any individual who wants to become more productive at home. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how deep their workload is, and what exactly theyâ€™re looking for.
- **Scope:** On register, first we would ask the user to choose tags that they are interested in (subject areas, everyday goals, working tasks), then create a personalized home page for each user based on their interests.
